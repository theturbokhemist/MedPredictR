# MedPredictR

This folder holds the model, our out of distribution detection, and the explainability code. The model and out of distribution detection code is in `Creating the model.ipynb`, and the explainability is in `Model Explainability.ipynb`. Full runs of each notebook with output saved are in `Project Notebook PDFs`.
